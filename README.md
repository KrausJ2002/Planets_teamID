In order to run this project succesfully, you need to set up the server to load textures.

If you dont already have NODE PACKAGE MANAGER (NPM) installed do so. 

after installing npm you need to open a new command line window by searching 'cmd' in windows search.

in the window you will run the command: npm i -g http-server

now navigate to the website file folder in the command line. run the command: http-server -p 8000

now visiting localhost:8000 allows you to visit the site.
